        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Effective Date: [LAUNCH DATE]</h2>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Cliick! We value transparency and user privacy and are committed to protecting your identity and content. We do not track, share, sell, or monitor your information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the limited information you provide when using our private network app. Your continued use of our services signifies your understanding of and agreement with this policy. Throughout this document, "you" refers to the individual accessing or using our services.
        </p>

        <h2>User Age Advisory</h2>
        <p>
            Cliick is intended for a general audience but is not designed for or directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, we do not collect or request age-related information from users. By using the app, you confirm that you are at least 13 years of age or have the consent of a legal guardian to use our services.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Cliick utilizes Google and Apple services to facilitate account creation, login, and payment processing. When you sign in or make payments using these services, we only interact with the basic information necessary to complete these actions. We do not collect or store any additional data from your Google or Apple accounts beyond what is needed for these functionalities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, Cliick does not share any user data with Google or Apple. The use of these services is strictly for account authentication and payment purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            For more information on how Google and Apple handle your data, please refer to their respective privacy policies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Privacy Policy:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Apple Privacy Policy:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            To provide our services, we may collect the following minimal information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>User Identification:</strong> When you create an account, we assign a random combination of characters as your User ID. This ID is used solely to represent the existence of a user within our network and does not contain any personal information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User Name:</strong> We collect your name as provided by your login provider (Google or Apple). This name is used as the default display name in your user profile within the app. You may change your display name at any time within the app settings. We do not keep or track previous names once you make changes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Content Media:</strong> We collect and store any media content you post or share within the app, including photos, videos, and text, as required to ensure the platform functions properly for your use.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not collect any additional personal data beyond what is necessary for these functionalities.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>
            We do not use the data we collect for any purposes beyond providing the core functionalities of the app. Specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>User Identification:</strong> The randomly generated User ID is used internally to manage user accounts and facilitate your interaction with the app.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User Name:</strong> Your name, as provided by your login provider, is used to create your default display name within the app. This allows other users to recognize you when interacting within the app. You have the option to change your display name at any time, and we do not retain previous names once changed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Content Media:</strong> The media content you share is stored only so that it can be accessed by you and other users (if applicable) within the app. We do not analyze, share, or use this content for any other purpose.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not use tracking technologies, algorithms, or data mining.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Storage:</strong> Your User ID, user name, and content media are securely stored on our servers, which are protected by industry-standard security measures, including encryption, to protect your data from unauthorized access.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>No Third-Party Sharing:</strong> We do not and will never share your data with any third parties. Your data remains private and is used only within the scope of the app's functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>User Identification and Name:</strong> Upon deletion of your account, the association between your User ID, your login provider, and your user name is severed. All personal information, including your display name, is deleted from our servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Content Media:</strong> The media content you upload to Cliick remains available within the app as long as you choose to keep it. You may delete any content that you control (e.g., content in your own circles) at any time, and it will be permanently removed from our servers. However, content that you post in other users' circles is not solely yours once shared; it becomes part of that group's shared experience and will remain within those circles even if you delete your account. If you wish to remove such content, you must manually delete it before closing your account.
        </p>
        <p>
            We ensure that all data associated with your account is removed from our servers and application upon deletion. Please note that while we can remove content from our platform, we cannot control how other users who have accessed or saved the content may use it. Once content is shared or viewed by other users, we do not have control over its subsequent use or distribution by those users.
        </p>

            <li>
                <strong>Deletion:</strong> You can request to have your content or account deleted at any time.
